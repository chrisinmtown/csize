Mon Jan 4 10:00:00 2021  Christopher Lott

	* Version 1.17
	* Declare externals correctly so code compiles
	* Drop some broken tests

Fri Mar 21 10:00:44 1997  Christopher Lott  <lott@dijon.bellcore.com>

	* README and others: removed duplicate contact info from files,
	  put updated info in the README.

Sun Apr  9 16:33:33 1995  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Version 1.16
	* INSTALL: added a note to say that flex version 2.5.1 works fine.
	* scan.l: fixed a few comments about the version number.

Sun Mar 12 09:53:25 1995  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Version 1.15
	* Makefile.in: started using shar from GNU sharutils, so it's no
	  longer necessary to pack up the test directory using tar.
	  Updated the INSTALL file to reflect the change.

Mon Mar  6 10:07:46 1995  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Makefile.in: added rules for zip.
	* t-dir/Makefile: added "-" before diff cmd; updated messages
	  in resonse to comments from Francois Pinard.
	* configure.in: updated for autoconf v2.1.
	* aclocal.m4: renamed as acsite.m4, made some changes.

Tue Feb 28 10:12:44 1995  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

        * README et al.: replaced rcs variable Id with RCSfile.  This
          means that the version number no longer appears in every source
          file, and patches become much smaller.
        * t-dir/TEST-OUT.sh: Changed "rm" to "rm -f"
        * t-dir/zzz-version.h: added to track version information.

Wed Jan 25 09:11:34 1995  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Version 1.14
	* scan.l: made code clean for C++ (tested with g++) by handling
	  flex's redefinition of input() -> yyinput() if the symbol 
	  __cplusplus is defined.  No other changes were necessary.
	  g++ still complains about a missing prototype for getopt(), 
	  but adding one results in a link error, curious.

Tue Oct 18 18:54:51 1994  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Version 1.13
	* scan.l: changed data type on two instances of variable 'c',
	  which is used to catch the value from input(), from char to int
	  after a bug report from an AIX user.  I suspect char's are
	  unsigned on his machine; clearly they are signed on the Sun, my
	  development platform.  Annoyingly, I had it right in one routine
	  but wrong in two others.
	* Finally documented my revision control process so that I'll
	  stick to it.  Generated a patch 1.12 -> 1.13.

Tue Oct 11 16:25:41 1994  Christopher Lott  <lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de>

	* Version 1.12
	* Makefile.in: removed the test directory's dependency on the
	  tarred/compressed/uuencoded file due to a loop.  The test
	  directory may be unpacked unnecessarily, but this is not as
	  serious as failing to generate a new tarred/compressed/uuencoded
	  file after the test data changes.

Fri Sep  2 08:37:36 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

	* csize.man: added mention that trigraphs are not supported, and
	  neither dollar signs nor at signs are accepted in identifiers.
	  Changed discussion of handling comments on preprocessor lines.

Thu Sep  1 14:54:43 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

	* Version 1.11
	* Responded to bug report from Sven-Ove Westberg <sow@cad.luth.se>
	  who correctly pointed out that csize was not properly handling
	  comments that occur on the same line as a preprocessor
	  directive.  Extended function pp_dir() to handle comments.

Sun Aug 21 13:16:15 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)
        * Version 1.10
	* Shortened file names to stay within the 14-character constraint
	  imposed by some sytems.
	* Added a missing closing quotation mark in the test directory
	  Makefile
	* Adapted to version 2.4.7 of flex.
	* Updated the README to admit that I do not fully utilize the
	  capabilities of the scanner.
	* Reworked the changelog into Gnu's accepted format
	* Moved function names in C files to column 1 to help ansi2knr
	* Moved Makefile to Makefile.in, reworked it for autoconf
	* Created configure.in so that I can use autoconf
	* Copied aclocal.m4 from GNUm4-1.2 directory
	* Created configure using autoconf
	* Updated the INSTALL file to state clearly the dependence on UNIX
	  systems, and to reflect the addition of configure.
	* Copied the install.sh file from GNUm4-1.2 for SYSV people.

Sun Jul 24 10:00:45 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

        * Version 1.9.
	* Failure: the string literal "\\" was not recognized properly.
	  Removed fault by reworking code to process backslashes in
	  string literals more intelligently.  
	* Did the same for pp dirs, where the same fault was lurking.

Wed Jul 29 07:12.49 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

        * Version 1.8
	* Split the README into a README and an INSTALL file.
	* Renamed version.h to patchlevel.h
	* Added a target to the Makefile for unpacking the tests.

Mon Jun 13 05:19:40 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

        * Version 1.7
	* Added code to handle the cases where a totally blank line
	  appears in a comment or a preprocessor directive.  Lines with
	  white-space characters were already being treated correctly, 
	  but lines with nothing but a newline were not.  In the cases
	  of comments or preprocessor directives, the line is not counted
	  in the blank-line category but instead in the comment or nonblank
	  noncomment line category, respectively.  
	* Updated the man page to explain these counting rules.
	* Added test cases (v-*) for these conditions.  Because counting
	  the blank lines depends on their surrounding context, I can't use
	  a grep/wc combination to verify the counts automatically.

Sun Jun 12 09:37:20 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

        * Version 1.6
	* Removed fault that caused string literal continuation lines 
	  not to be counted correctly as nonblank noncomment lines.
	  This was difficult and resulted in much reorganization of
	  the code that counts nonblank noncomment lines, newlines, 
	  comments, and pp dirs to be more modular.
	* Added test cases for continuation lines in string literals
	  and in preprocessor directives.
	* Added -v flag == print version information.  
	  Updated the man page accordingly.
	  Added file version.h, updated the Makefile.
	* Updated the README to warn about different implementations
	  of getopt() that cause mismatches in the test ouput.  This
	  is not a serious problem.
	* Added many comments to explain the inner workings of the
	  counting functions. 

Fri Jun 10 08:44:26 1994  Christopher Lott  (lott@bogner.informatik.uni-kl.de)

        * Version 1.5
	* Put files under revision control
	* Added preprocessor directives:
	  include_next, import, warning, sccs, ident, assert, unassert.
	  I can't find documentation of #indent in K&R 1/e, K&R 2/e,
	  or even in Stroustrup _C++_ 2/e.  However, GCC's info file
	  mentions it, and it's supported both by gcc and Sun's cc.
	  The rest came from reading version 2.5.8 of GCC's cccp.c.
	  Changed the man page to reflect the additions.
	* removed fault that caused string literals with embedded
	  backslashes and newlines to be handled improperly.
	  Added function string_lit() to process all string literals.
	* Removed fault that caused backslashes outside of string
	  literals to generate a "bad character" message.  Added a lex
	  rule.  Now they are recognized, but the backslash processing
	  is still not sophisticated.

Changes between versions 1.3 and 1.4:

	* Removed faults that caused multi-line comments to threw off
	  the newline count and to echo comments improperly.
	  Both were removed by switching back to the original
	  comment-eating code; dropped use of the code from flexdoc(1).
	* Removed fault that caused nonempty whitespace lines not to be
	  echoed verbatim 
	* Removed fault that caused blank line immediately after pp
	  directive to be ignored.  Changed pp-eating code to give
	  back the newline that terminates the pp directive; this
	  allows the scanner to recognize the beginning of a line (^)
	  in the pattern for whitespace lines.
	* Removed ^ before pattern for preprocessor directives; i.e.,
	  they will be recognized even if non-whitespace preceeds
	  them.  This deviates from the spec in K&R 2/e but matches
	  gcc's behavior.  Changed the man page to reflect this.
	* Aadded more cases to the regression test suite to detect faults.

Changes between versions 1.2 and 1.3:

	* Upgraded to flex version 2.4.6; forced me to work around a
	  bug in flex - use yyrestart(FILE *) to set up the scanner.
	* Removed fault that caused the the closing */ of a comment
	  to be omitted in the echoed output.

Changes between versions 1.1 and 1.2:

	* Replaced comment-eating code with example from flexdoc(1) man page
	* lex could not count pp dirs properly, so I gave up on lex
	  and switched to using flex.
	* Cleaned up man page and Makefile
	* Added scan.c.flex to the distribution for those w/o flex

Release 1.1 of csize:

	* First release to interested parties.
