README for the directory of tests (t-dir).

This directory contains a set of regression tests for csize.
Included here are files that were sent to me by users of csize,
especially those that caused faults to manifest themeselves
as failures.

Nearly all of the files in this directory are accepted by the
C compiler.  Those that are not are those with unterminated
comments, unterminated preprocessor directives, etc.; in short,
the pathological cases I used to test csize.

CMP-COUNTS.sh:

This script compares the values computed by the program to values
computed using standard unix commands such as grep, awk, and wc. 
If you're using a PC or other non-unix system, you can't run this
script.  This shell script also requires writing the data files for
consumption by grep.  For example, the string COMMENT appears in
every comment line in every file in this directory so that a grep
for COMMENT will give the desired results.  See the comments in the
shell script for other hard-wired dependencies on the contents of
the test data files.

TEST-COUNTS.sh:

Calls the CMP-COUNTS.sh script on most of the files in this
directory.  If the program computes an incorrect count, this test
suite *should* find it. 

The output from running the shell script TEST-COUNTS.sh should
match the output stored in the file TEST-COUNTS.ok

TEST-OUTPUT.sh:

The tests run by this script exercise the program and compare
the output to output generated on my machine.  This checks that
we both see the same behavior.  If the program has a fault that
causes a failure (miscount) on both of our machines, this test
suite will not find it.

The output from running the shell script TEST-OUTPUT.sh should
match that stored in the file TEST-OUTPUT.ok
